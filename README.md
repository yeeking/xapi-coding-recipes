# xapi-coding-recipes
A repository of xAPI recipes to describe actions taken by people writing computer programs. 

This repository was developed so we could log activity  our educational programming environment, codecircle in a standard format. Codecircle can be seen at [http://live.codecircle.com]. This would then allow us to develop learning analytics etc. that are more easily transferred to other datasets.
